###RStudio Continued:

**In a chunk:**
{r, echo=FALSE} vs. {r, eval=FALSE}   
echo-> you see plot in output   
eval-> you don't see plot in output   

**New Commands:**   
shift/command/enter = source with echo   
Notebook icon for .R -> .html (cool!)   
ctrl/l = new, clean console line   
library(knitr) -> purl = pulls chunks out of .Rmd and transforms into .R   

(#') in .R will render as markdown and will show as a sentence in the .html
