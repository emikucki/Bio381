**Regular Expressions**

Use plain text editor (textwrangler)  

Editor defaults -> soft wrap text -> window width    

cntrl/f -> matching -> grep     
grep= global regular expression print   

replace one at a time; can't undo replace all   

####Types of characters
literal characters - characters as is "." is a "."   
metacharacters - special characters that represent something else (".", "#", etc.)   
"escaping the metacharacter" = search literally for that special character add \ before    

using grep = red (regular formatting); "." actually searching for a "wild card" - every single character    

####List of useful metacharacters (i.e. wildcards)
```
\w = a single "word" character    
-> (all caps, all lowercase, 0-9, and _)   
\d = a single number character    
-> (0-9)   
\t = a single tab space    
\s = a single tab, space or line break   
\n = a single line break   
. = any single letter, digit, space, symbol or a line (anything!)   
* all of the above only search for one thing  
```

__________________________________________________________
```
find \s ; replace with \n = puts things on separate lines 
crow raven grackle **to**
crow    
raven    
grackle   

find \.\s   
replace \.\n    
(does something....)   
```
__________________________________________________________

####Negated wildcards 
```
=predefined set of characters    
\W = NOT \w (complimentary negated)   
\D = NOT \d    
\T    
\S  
```

####Custom character sets
```
[what follows will define my character set]   
[A-Za-z]    
[ACTG]    
```

**Negated character sets**   
```
[^A-Z] = anything but a capital letter    
[^A-Za-z_0-9] = equal to \W    
[^\t] = anything except a tab = \T   
```

**Quantifiers**   
```
\w+ = 1 or more consecutive word characters   
does not get things like (), ., etc.    
\w* = 0 or more consecutive word characters    
     \w{3} = exactly 3 consecutive word characters    
\w{3,5} = exactly 3, 4 or 5 matches    
\w{3,} = 3 or more matches   
[ACTG]{3,}   
find \s*,\s*   
replace ,   
^ shows how to get rid of unwanted spaces   

.+ grabs everything (1 or more)   
.* grabs everything (0 or more)   

( ) keeps the wanted materials   

**replace \1 = first set of parentheses**    
**\2 # \1** flip, add a # and reverse the parentheses (keepers)   
```
