#Basic data structures in R
#February 14, 2017
#Emily Mikucki

#Use the assignment operator 
x <- 5 #preferred way to run code
y = 4 #legal but confusing
y = y + 1.1 
y<- y + 1.1 #better to do it this way 
print(y)

#Variable names (determine how comprehensible your data set is)

z <- 3 #begin with lowercase (common in coding)
plant_height <- 3.3 #OR
plant.height <- 4 #but sometimes used in functions SO
plantHeight <- 3 #camelCaseFormatting

#The Combine Function
z <- c(3.2, 5, 5, 6) #z is now a vector
print(z)
typeof(z)
is.numeric(z)


z <- c(c(3,4),c(5,6))
print(z)

#character strings surrounded by single or double quotes 

z <- c("perch","bass",'trout')
print(z)

z<-c("This is only 'one' character string","this is a second")
print(z)

typeof(z)
is.numeric(z)

#building logicals
#no quotes, all caps
z <-c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
is.logical(z)


#Three properties of vectors
#type
is.logical(z)
typeof(z)
str(z)#structure

#length
length(z)

# names
z <- runif(5)
print(z)
#names are optional 
names(z)
names (z) <- c("chow", "pug", "beagle","greyhound", "akita")
print(z)

#add names with variable creation (with or without quotes)

z2 <- c(gold=3.3, silver=10, lead=2) #don't need quotes
print(z2)

#reset names
names(z2) <- NULL
print(z2)

###Three features of atomic variables 
#Coercion
z <- c(3, "eggs")
typeof(z)
print(z)

#hierarchy of coercion

#logical -> integer -> double -> character

#Comparison operators yield a logic variable 

a <- runif(10)
a > 0.5 
print(a)

#how many elements are greater than 0.5?
sum(a > 0.5) #1 = TRUE, 0 = FALSE

#what proportion of the elements are > 0.5?
mean(a > 0.5)

#Qualifying exam question: approximately what proportion of observations drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1, are larger than 2.0?

mean(rnorm(1000) > 2)

###Vectorization
z<-c(10,20,30)
z + 1
y <- c(1,2,3)
z + y 

y <-c(1,2)

z^2 +z

###Recycling
y <- c(1,2)
z <- c(10,20,30)
y + z 
z <- c(10,20,30,40)
y + z

#Creating Vectors
z <- vector(mode="numeric",length=0)
print(z)
#add an element to z 
z <- c(z,5) #dynamic sizing, but never do this because it's so slow!
print(z)

#create vector of predetermined length 
z<-rep(0,100)
head(z)
str(z)

z <- rep(NA, 100) #using coercion
typeof(z)

z[1] <- "Washington"
typeof(z)
